# Hector Observing Database

The file `hector.db` is an [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database which contains a number of different tables tracking the progress of the Hector Galaxy Survey. 

This documentation talks you through the kind of data each table stores, how to query them and how to make updates after an observing run. There's also a cookbook of useful recipes.
